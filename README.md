# Airline-Passengers-Satisfaction-Prediction
Project Overview

This project is about predicting whether an airline passenger is satisfied or not based on different features like seat comfort, inflight service, cleanliness, and other travel-related factors.
I used a machine learning approach to analyze the data and predict passenger satisfaction levels.

Objective

The main goal of this project is to find out what factors influence passenger satisfaction and to build a model that can predict if a passenger will be satisfied or dissatisfied.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas and NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model

Steps Followed

Data Preprocessing

Removed missing values and unnecessary columns.

Used One Hot Encoding for categorical columns.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Building

Used Random Forest Classifier to predict satisfaction.

Trained the model on the training data.

Tested the model on unseen data.

Model Evaluation

Checked accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Used a confusion matrix to see correct and incorrect predictions.

Results

The Random Forest model gave good accuracy.
It showed that features like inflight service, seat comfort, and cleanliness play an important role in deciding passenger satisfaction.
